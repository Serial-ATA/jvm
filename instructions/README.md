# JVM/instructions

Definitions
for [The Java Virtual Machine Instruction Set](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se23/html/jvms-6.html), and
the [Operand Stack](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se23/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.6.2).

This crate only provides the definitions for the instruction set and operand stack. The implementation is housed
in [the runtime crate](../runtime).
